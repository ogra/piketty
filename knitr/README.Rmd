Replicate Figures & Tables from [Thomas Piketty, Capital in the 21st Century, Harvard University Press, 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century).  

Based on Professor Piketty's [technical appendices](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/capital21c2).

This repository, named **slides**, contains *KnitR/LaTeX/Beamer* source code to produce all book figures as standalone **.pdf** and **.png** files, and a set of basic beamer slides for all the figures. The source has extension **.Rnw**. Users of *LaTeX* may copy-paste code from the associated **.tex** files. Thomas Piketty's original data is available in the sub-directory **Piketty2014FiguresTables** in **.xlsx** format. The *KnitR/LaTeX* source files are in the sub-directory **slides**. 


I) **FILES/SCRIPTS**:  

    1) ``'dataFiguresTables.Rnw'``  
    -- a knitr code chunk.  
    -- pulls the data from the Piketty spreadsheets and puts it in ready form for printing.  
    -- it may be run from the R console by omitting the first and last lines, i.e. by commenting out as follows:  

        ```r
        # <<'data', include=FALSE, cache=FALSE>>=
        Whatever comes here is the 'chunk' of R code
        # @
        ```
    -- ... if you wish to recreate the data as you create the figures and slides, call it from ``slidesFigures.Rnw`` as a code chunk, in which case comment out every call to ``load()`` that appears inside each figure, e.g.: 

        ```r
        # load("data/df_1_!.Rda") 
        ```     

    2) ``'slidesFigures.Rnw'``  
    -- a knitr/beamer document.  
    -- it may be run from the R console or in Rstudio by pressing the 'Compile PDF' button.  
    -- produces beamer slides for all of the book's figures.  
    -- produces standalone ``.pdf`` and ``.png`` figures stored in ``data`` subdirectory.  

    3) ``'slidesTextPikettyPowerpoint.tex'``  
    -- a LaTeX/beamer document.  
    -- contains beamer slides cloned from some of Professor Piketty's powerpoint presentations.  
    
    4) ``'beamerthemepiketty.sty'``  
    -- a LaTeX/beamer theme style file.  
    -- contains a series of customization to obtain a standard, neutral theme.  
    -- for instance, frame titles are in a small-ish font to accommodate the sometimes long titles in Piketty's presentations. A hack makes the euro symbol available to LaTeX and searchable in the PDF (wow!).  
    
    5) ``'slidesPikettySaoPaulo2014.tex'``  
    -- a LaTeX/beamer command.  
    -- calls ``\includeonlyframes`` command with a list of frame labels to be included to reproduce the Sao Paulo 2014 presentation.  
    
    6) ``'slidesFiguresRename.Rnw'``  
    -- an ugly hack designed to rename the Figures in a way consistent with the Piketty book. It is called from 'slidesFigures.Rnw', at the very end. If omitted, the figures will be named e.g. 'Figure_x_y-1.png' instead of 'Figure_x_y.png'.  

    7) ``'slidesFigures-bw.pdf'`` and ``'slidesFigures-color.pdf'``  
    -- the pdf beamer containing all the book figures (plus a few extra).  

    8) ``'slidesFigures.tex'`` 
    -- a LaTeX file produced by knitr.  
    -- may be compiled with ``pdflatex``, which is what knitr calls.  
    -- can be useful for debugging.  

    9) ``'bookFiguresTitles.R'``
    -- a list of all the figure titles.  
    -- figure titles are currently empty with same titles inside '\beamertitle'  

    10) ``'pgfbaseimage.sty'``  
    -- a hack designed to remove a warning when compiling the beamer class.   
    -- may be safely omitted.  
    
    11) ``'slidesFigures-concordance.tex'``, files with  ``'.vrb'``, ``'.nav'``, ``.snm``, ``.synctex.gz``, ``.toc``  
    -- various files produced by knitr as a by-product of compilation.  
    -- may or not be present in repository.  
    -- may be safely deleted.  


II) **FOLDERS/DIRECTORIES**:

    1) ``data``  
    -- contains data created with ``dataFiguresTables.Rnw``  
    -- data stored as dataframes in format ``.Rda``  
    -- files named ``TSx_y.Rda`` contain data from Piketty's worksheet labeled ``TSx.y`` occasional worksheet named ``cTSx.y``  
    -- files named ``df_x_y.Rda``  contain dataframes used to recreate figure ``x.y``, i.e. figure ``y`` from Chapter ``x``
    
    2) ``figures/bw``  
    -- contains black & white versions of the figures in ``.pdf`` and ``.png`` formats.
    
    3) ``figures/color``  
    -- contains color versions of the figures. in ``.pdf`` and ``.png`` formats.
    
    4) ``pictures``  
    -- contains images and figures not directly imported into the beamer documents, e.g. a screenshot of the 'World Top Incomes Database' website.
    
    5) ``pikettySlides/original``  
    -- contains copies of a sample of Professor Piketty's powerpoint presentations.

    6) ``pikettySlides/cloned``  
    -- contains 'cloned' versions of Professor Piketty's powerpoint presentations created with knitr/beamer.  
    
    7) ``cache``  
    -- contains the 'cache' created by knitr as a by-product of compilation.  
    -- may or not be present in repository.  
    -- may be safely deleted.  


III) **KNOWN ISSUES**:  

    1) See ``'slidesFigures.Rnw'`` for inline comments about limitations.  
    2) I have tried to make the code reasonably 'transferrable' by copy-paste, but there are 4 main exceptions to this principle:  
        1) The beamer theme named ``'piketty'`` defined in ``'beamerthemepiketty.sty'``.  
        2) The ggplot theme named ``'theme_piketty()'`` defined in the preamble of ``'slidesFigures.Rnw'``.  
        3) The ``linePalette``, ``colorPalette``, ``shapePalette`` and ``fillPalette`` defined in the preamble of ``'slidesFigures.Rnw'``.  
        4) The ``ggplot_dual_axis()`` function used to produce dual-axis graphs and defined in ``'beamerthemepiketty.sty'``.  
        
    3) Figures 9.9, 12.1, and 12.2 are dual-axis graphs produced by function ``ggplot_dual_axis()``. This custom function extends ggplot functionalities to dual axis plots. This function is in need of a major overhaul. This function has one major problem: the rhs axis grid overwrites the data and legend. I do know how to fix it, just need an hour or two...
