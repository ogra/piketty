### Notes on Thomas Piketty's Capital
#### by Patrick Toche

- This page contains material related to Thomas Piketty, Capital in the 21st Century (Harvard University Press, 2014), in particular slides, data, tables and figures. 
- This project was started in January 2015 and is expected to be updated on a weekly basis until May 2015.
- The project is open source. 
- The html slides may be viewed here: **[http://ptoche.github.io/](http://ptoche.github.io/)**
- The whole project may be downloaded from: **[https://github.com/ptoche/piketty](https://github.com/ptoche/piketty)**
- The project contains html5 slides with text and figures (directory named 'slidify') and basic pdf slides with figures only (directory named 'knitr'). Figures are available in pdf, png, and html format.

### Reproduce

This website is based on the slidify framework (author: Ramnath Vaidyanathan). The source files are hosted on github and you may download the whole project as a zip file or fork it to a github repository in your account. To compile this website from source, configure the `site.yml` and run `slidify('index.Rmd')`. 

You will need the `slidify`, `slidifyLibraries` and `rCharts`, packages.

    install.packages("devtools")  
    devtools::install_github(c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts"), 
        "ramnathv", ref = "dev")  

In addition, I often use the following packages: `ggplot2`, `scales`, `reshape2`, `plyr` (author: Hadley Wickham). I am also using packages `grid` and `png` to insert images and control their size. See the source code for a full list of packages used. Make sure these packages are installed in your `R` system, e.g. run this for each package:

    install.packages("ggplot2")

Write a short slide deck and publish it to [Github](http://www.github.com) with a few clicks using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), with a single line of code.

### Layout

The `lectures` folder holds the lecture slides, one subfolder per lecture. The site's architecture looks like this:

```
assets      -> custom img/js/css/layout assets
data        -> Piketty's data used for the tables and figures
figures     -> png figures built with ggplot2 library
images      -> other images used to illustrate the slides
lectures    -> folder containing lectures
  Chapter 01
  Chapter 02
  Chapter 03
libraries   -> frameworks, highlighters and widgets
shared      -> custom setup across all lectures, e.g. knitr chunks
index.Rmd   -> Rmd source for home page
site.yml    -> Site related configuration
slidify.R   -> Several useful commands to compile the files
```
