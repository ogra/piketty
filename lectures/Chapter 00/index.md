### 21世紀の資本

- 私達は所得の分配について何を知っているか。
- 私達は富の分配について何を知っているか。
- 所得と富の長期的な進化についてどんな予測ができるか。
- 民間の資本蓄積の力がより一層少ない人々に富を集中させることは避けられないのか。
- 成長、競争および技術的な進歩を均衡させる力は不平等を減らし階級間の衝突を減らすのに充分強くなり得るか。
- この導入部は不平等の非常に簡単な歴史を提示し、本書の主題について描写する。

### アダム・スミスと貧困

- 1776年にアダム・スミスは彼の研究を *『国富論』* で出版した。
- アダム・スミスは「最初の経済学者」だと考えられている。彼が生きた社会では、貧困、飢餓、若年の死が一般的であった。この混沌の中で、彼は経済を奇跡、「見えざる手」の仕業以外の何物でもないと考えた。
- スミスにとって、豊かな社会は不平等であり、遅れた社会の不平等がより少ない限り、その社会は貧しい社会である。
- 資本蓄積は資本の限界生産性を下げ、労働の限界生産性を上げ、平等を減らすことに寄与するとスミスは考えた。
- 社会が発展するにつれて、平等と豊かさが達成されるとスミスは期待した。

### マルサスと人口過剰の問題
 
- 1798年、トマス・マルサスが *人口論* を出版した。彼の主な懸念は人口過剰であった。
- フランス王国の人口は1700年の2000万人から1780年までに3000万人に増加した。この非常に急速な人口増加により、1789年の革命以前の数十年で、農業の賃金上昇が停滞し地代が上昇した。
- 国家がより豊かになると、人口が増え、典型的な貧しい家庭の資源は減少したので、貧しい者はより貧しくなった。この不幸な逆説がマルサスを悩ませた。
- 人口過剰、混乱、不幸を防ぐために、貧しい者の出産は減らされなければならず、その実現のために福祉の支援は削減されなければならないとマルサスは主張した。

### Ricardo and the Principle of Scarcity

- In 1817, Ricardo published his *Principles of Political Economy and Taxation*. His main concern was the long-term evolution of land prices and land rents. 
- Ricardo thought capitalism suffered from an internal contradiction. 
- As both population and output grow steadily, land tends to become increasingly scarce relative to other goods. The law of supply and demand then implies that the price of land will rise continuously, as will the rents paid to landlords. The landlords will therefore claim a growing share of national income, at the expense of the rest of the population.
- For Ricardo, a politically acceptable solution was to impose a steadily increasing tax on land rents.

---

### Ricardo and the Principle of Scarcity

- Ricardo's prediction proved wrong: the share of agriculture in national income decreased and the relative value of farm land declined.
- Ricardo had not anticipated the importance of technological progress and its role in offsetting the principle of scarcity.
- The principle of scarcity remains important: replace the price of farmland with the price of urban real estate and consider what would happen to wealth inequality if the price trend of 1970–2010 were extrapolated to 2010–2050!
- The mechanism of supply and demand eventually counterbalances extreme trends: If the supply of some good is short and its price too high, then demand for that good would decrease and eventually its price would decrease.

### Marx and the Kapital

- In 1867, Marx published the first volume of *Capital*. The other two volumes would be published posthumously by Friedrich Engels, the co-author of the *Communist Manifesto* (1848).
- The question was no longer whether farmers could feed a growing population or whether land prices would go on rising.
- During the first half of the 19th century wages stagnated at very low levels, in some cases even lower than previous centuries. 
- The capital income share increased considerably in Britain and France in the first half of the 19th century.
- With the industrial revolution and the vast rural exodus workers crowded into urban slums. Poverty was now visible in urban areas side by side with extreme opulence. 

---

### Marx and the Falling Rate of Profit

- Marx predicted a tendency for capitalists to accumulate wealth without limit and for wealth to become concentrated into ever fewer hands. 
- Marx predicted the excessive accumulation of capital would lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism. 
- Marx saw the tendency of the profit rate to fall as 'the most important law of political economy.' As the rate of profit fell, capitalists would seek to extract more surplus and workers' wages would stagnate or fall.
- Marx's prediction proved wrong. In the last third of the nineteenth century, wages finally began to increase.
- The communist revolution took place in the most backward country in Europe, Russia, and not in the advanced industrial countries.

### Simon Kuznets and the Kuznets Curve

- In 1953, Kuznets published *Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings*, a study of the United States over 1913–1948. 
- Kuznets noted a sharp reduction in the upper deciles of income between 1913 and 1948. In 1913, the top 10% of US earners received 45–50% of annual national income. In 1948, they earned 30–35%.
- The 'Kuznets curve' interpretation is that inequality rises in the early stages of industrialization &mdash; falls later. An explanation is due to W. Arthur Lewis (1915-1991). In early stages, 'unlimited' supply of labour from rural areas allows urban areas to expand without upward pressure on wages. Wages rise once rural-urban migration stops.
- In truth, however, the compression of high incomes was largely accidental, caused by the Great Depression and World War II.

---

### Piketty's Capital

- While Marx's vision was a nightmare, the Kuznets curve is a fairy tale.
- Piketty seeks to ground his theories on facts. He surveys economic data spanning several centuries and continents.
- Piketty's theory places the data within a simple, universal accounting framework and focuses on the very long run.
- Piketty's vision of the future draws from history and does not speculate about future technologies or future societies.
- This 'lack of imagination' leads Piketty to search for fiscal solutions to the economic and political problem of inequality.
- Piketty advocates high taxes on high incomes and wealth transmission.

### Forces of Convergence & Divergence

- **Convergence**
    - The main force is the diffusion of knowledge.
    - depends on education policies, access to skills, institutions.
- **Divergence**
    - `1.` Top earners earn hundreds of times average earnings. 
    - `2.` Wealth concentration tends to occur when economic growth is smaller than the rate of return on wealth.
    - We have become accustomed to 1, thanks to the work of Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, and many others.
    - We are now discovering 2 thanks to Piketty's book and the dire warnings of Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, and others.

### Forces of Convergence & Divergence

- Figures I.1 and I.2 show two basic patterns of divergence. 
    - Figure I.1 depicts income inequality in the United States.
    - Figure I.2 depict the capital/income ratio in 3 European countries. 
- Both graphs depict "U-shaped curves": A period of decreasing inequality followed by one of increasing inequality. 
- But the phenomena depicted in the figures involve distinct economic, social, and political processes. 

---

### Forces of Convergence & Divergence

- Figure I.1 shows the share of the upper decile of the income hierarchy in US national income from 1910 to 2010. 
- The top decile claimed as much as 45–50% of national income in the 1910s–1920s, fell to 30–35% by the end of the 1940s, rose again in the 1980s, and by 2000 reached about 45–50%.
- Figure I.2 shows the total value of private wealth (in real estate, financial assets, and professional capital, net of debt) in Britain, France and Germany, expressed in years of national income, for 1870–2010. 
- The total amount of private wealth was about 6 or 7 years of national income in the 19th c., fell sharply to 2 or 3 years, in response to the shocks of the period 1914–1945, started to rise steadily after 1950, and is up to about 5 years in 2010.

### Income Inequality in the United States

- The spectacular increase in inequality largely reflects an unprecedented explosion of very elevated incomes from labor, caused by a separation of the top managers of large firms from the rest of the population.
- Did the skills and productivity of these top managers rise suddenly in relation to those of other workers? 
- Do we live in a 'winner takes all' society?
- Top managers suddenly acquired the power to set their own remuneration. The 'winner grabs all' society!
- The tendency is less marked in other wealthy countries, but the trend is in the same direction.

---

### The capital-income ratio

- The rise of capital/income ratios over the past few decades is in large part a return to a regime of slow growth. 
- If the rate of return on capital remains above the growth rate for an extended period of time, then wealth becomes more concentrated.
- In slowly growing economies, past wealth matters more.
- The logic is captured by an inequality:
$$ 
r > g
$$
where r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital, including profits, dividends, interest, rents, and other income from capital, and g stands for the rate of growth of the economy, that is, the annual proportional change in total income.
